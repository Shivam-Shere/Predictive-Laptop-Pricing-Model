# 🖥️ Predictive Laptop Pricing Tool (Machine Learning Project)

### Welcome to the Predictive Laptop Pricing Tool! 

## 1. Title:  Predictive Laptop Pricing Tool! 
 
This project uses machine learning to estimate laptop prices based on hardware specifications. With an end-to-end pipeline (ETL → Feature Engineering → ML Modeling → Deployment), it helps users to explore price insights through an interactive Streamlit web app.


## 2. Purpose:

The Predictive Laptop Pricing Tool is a machine learning app that estimates laptop prices based onAn interactive ML tool to predict laptop prices based on specifications like RAM, processor, storage, and GPU,etc. Featuring an end-to-end pipeline, it helps users, tech enthusiasts, and businesses to explore pricing trends and make data-driven laptop decisions via a Streamlit web app.



## 3. Technical Stack: 

- **Python:** Programming language

- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data cleaning and preprocessing

- **Scikit-Learn:** Model training and evaluation

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization

- **Machine Learning(Algorithms)**

- **Streamlit:** Web application 


## 4. Data Source: 

- *Data Source: Kaggle – Laptop Price Estimation Dataset*

This dataset simulates real-world laptop pricing patterns and contains detailed specifications such as brand, processor type and speed, RAM capacity, storage configuration, screen size, weight, and other hardware features. It provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing how different laptop attributes influence pricing and for building machine learning models that estimate laptop prices accurately.

## 5. Features:
### - *Business Problem-*

Laptop prices vary widely depending on hardware specifications, making it difficult for buyers, retailers, and analysts to compare configurations or estimate fair pricing. Manually evaluating how components like RAM, processor type, GPU, and storage affect the final price is time-consuming and often inaccurate.

### - *Goal of the Application-*

To provide an interactive, ML-powered tool that:

1. Predicts laptop prices based on user-selected hardware specifications.

2. Helps consumers make informed purchase decisions.

3. Offers a smooth UI for exploring how each feature contributes to laptop cost.


### - *Walkthrough of Key Features-* 

1. **Brand & Type Selection:** Choose from multiple laptop brands and categories.

2. **Hardware Inputs:** Configure RAM, weight, touchscreen, IPS display, and screen size using clean UI components.

3. **Display & Processor Options:** Select screen resolution and CPU type to reflect performance levels.

4. **Storage Configuration:** Specify HDD/SSD capacities for modern or hybrid setups.

5. **GPU & OS Selection:** Pick graphics type and operating system to refine pricing accuracy.

6. **Instant Prediction:** A single click generates the estimated laptop price using the trained ML model.


### - *Business Impact-*

1. Helps consumers make data-driven purchase decisions.

2. Enables retailers to benchmark competitive pricing.

3. Provides a practical learning example of end-to-end ML deployment.
